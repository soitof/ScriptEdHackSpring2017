		<p class="summary"> Hey there, feeling down? We're here to help with that. We're also here to tell you that you shouldn't be ashamed of your sexuality, or what you think you may be feeling. The truth is, there will always be someone who will accept you for who you are. 
		You may be confused, and you may be scared feel alone in the world. That the world is against you. But it's not. And neither are we. In fact, this website is here to help you come to terms with yourself. 
		Being LGTBQ or any other letter of the alphabet does not make you someone that will be automatically damnned for eternity, 
		and it is not a disease. It is part of you, and you are beautiful (or handsome, take it as you may). Goodluck  </p>
